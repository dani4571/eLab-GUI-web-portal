- title: Machine Learning Certification
  description: Neural Network is inspired from our biological neural system. High end technologies these days, do not require human intervention for its functioning. Humans key in the algorithm to make it predict results, automate the decision making process and thereby promoting smart moves on the classification / recognition problem at hand. The following sections of tutorials are potential sources of information providing the key concepts of machine learning, catering to users of all levels.
