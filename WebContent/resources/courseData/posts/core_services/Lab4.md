## Introduction 
Glance is OpenStack’s Image Service. It imparts discovery, registration and delivery services for server and disk images. It is the core openstack service which allows the creation of virtual disk images and storing them. The images that are stored can be used as templates which the clients can use to get a new server up and running easily. The virtual machine images can be stored in backends, local file systems, or even in the openstack object storage - Swift. 

Glance image services uses a client-server architecture which allows you to have a REST API. It can be used to respond to the requests to the server.

Let us now familiarize with the Glance Service in the Horizon Dashboard:

For example, the ubuntu cloud image for trusty server is available at :[images](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/trusty/current/trusty-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img)

The kernel field is meant for AMI style image. It denotes the ID of the image stored in glance.
Minimum Disk denotes the minimum disk size required to boot the image and Minimum RAM denotes the minimum memory size. 

Public checkbox is checked only if the image can be shared with all other tenants. By default, the access is provided ONLY for Admin.
