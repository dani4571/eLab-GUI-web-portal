# Face Verification

### About the Application

Facial recognition algorithms aim to do verification and identification, two separate but related tasks. Verification involves trying to correctly determine whether two faces presented to the facial recognition algorithm belong to the same person. Identification involves trying to find a matching photo of the same person among a million “distractor” faces. Facial recognition is useful in applications such as social media, security, and automated vehicle. Recent sginificant improvment in facial recognition is the result of designing **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)**. This novel designs not only include increasing the size of the network but also prsenting new loss functions, stack of complex modules, and encoding the input image of the person face. Here the comprehensive module is presented for verification; since identification can be based on the accurate verification.
