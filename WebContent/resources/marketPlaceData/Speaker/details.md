# Speaker Recognition

### About the Application

Objective is to train a neural network to be able to recognize a speaker by their voice. So the problem being addressed first is not Speech Recognition but Speaker Classification. This is currently done by a support vector machine that inputs the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) arrays and then travels through two fully connected layers separated by a dropout layer. MFFC's are are widely used in speech and speaker recognition systems.
